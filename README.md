## Call center trend data analysis

* Gauge Charts: The gauge charts display the speed at which queries were answered and customer satisfaction levels.
* Donut Charts: The donut charts show the percentage of calls answered and resolved.
* Bar Chart: The bar chart illustrates the number of calls answered for each month.
* Line Chart: The line chart displays the timings of when agents were called to address queries.
* Agent Statistics Table: The table provides a detailed view of all agents, including relevant information such as calls answered and duration. 


The slicers and agent statistics table are used to select specific date, agent name and branch of the agent. This further changes the visualization for each different selection.
